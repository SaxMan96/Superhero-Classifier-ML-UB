  - python, numpy, pandas ... etc
  - kaggle, jupyter
- Kaggle account - to download and submit to Kaggle

# Setting up environment

- Clone this repository (you don't need to download the data from Kaggle, because it is already in repository, but try do do this by Kaggle API so you know that you will be able to submit it if needed)
- Create virtual environment from attached file (TO BE DONE)
- Run notebook (TO BE DONE)

# Work Split

- Data analysis
  - Decide what to do with NaNs
  - How to factorize some features
  - Plot distributions [?] if needed for report 
- Data engineering
  - NaNs
  - Factorization
  - Feature selection [?]
- Model Selection - performance check not needed so no Test set 
  - Choose models to test
  - Cross Validation
  - Train
  - Valid
- Submit
  - Train Model on whole set
  - Create output file (programmatically)
